# Features

- Open Editor File Context: Codefly CLI gains awareness of the files you have
  open in your editor, providing it with a richer understanding of your
  project's structure and content.

- Selection Context: Codefly CLI can easily access your cursor's position and
  selected text within the editor, giving it valuable context directly from your
  current work.

- Native Diffing: Seamlessly view, modify, and accept code changes suggested by
  Codefly CLI directly within the editor.

- Launch Codefly CLI: Quickly start a new Codefly CLI session from the Command
  Palette (Cmd+Shift+P or Ctrl+Shift+P) by running the "Codefly CLI: Run"
  command.
